## 🔗 Previous Version  
The earlier version of this project can be accessed here:  
<a href="https://faldi17.github.io/sun-earth-moon/" target="_blank">Sun-Earth-Moon Simulation</a>.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **React + Vite** – Fast performance with HMR.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Modern and responsive styling.  
- **Framer Motion** – Smooth animations for planetary motion.  

## React + Vite  

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.  

Currently, two official plugins are available:  

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.  

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration  

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
